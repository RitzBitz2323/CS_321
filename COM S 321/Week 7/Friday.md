### Notes
A circuit for 1 ghz aka 1 bil cycles per second
~
- Clock rate is dictated by the time neccesary for the circuit to reach "steady state"
- Steady State is state which flow of electrons is constant and charges in units are constant

*States of the classic 5 stage principle*

```
Assumed pipline clock rate is 1 ghz

Stages of Classic 5 stage pipeline
Clock Rate is dictated by the time required to reach steady state in the slowest unit -> 4ghz

up to 5 instructions running at a time. Throughput is 4x that of unpipielined processor
```

```
1. ADD X9, X10, X11

2. ADD X8, X9, X12

## Signed Binary Numbers
- *One's Complement*
	- To negate: invert all bits
	- Two zeros
	- Range [ -(2<sup>bits-1</sup> -1),  (2<sup>bits-1</sup> -1) ]
	- Examples
		- 97 base 10 = 01100001 base 2
		- -97 base 10 = 10011110 base 2
		- -34 + 51
		- 00100010 - >        11011101 +
		- 00110011.               00110011
		-                 00010000. (16)
		- Take the carry value from the addition and add it to the result
		- so therefore it becomes 00010001 ( 17 )
- *Two's Complement*
	- Invert all bits and add one to negate
	- Throw away carries
	- Example
		- Only one zero
		- -34 + 51
		- -34 = 11011110 base 2
		- 51 = 00110011 base 2
		- 17 = 00010001
#### ARM Assembly Language
- Textbook is based on armv8 presents a pedegogical subset armv8 which it calls LEGv8
- ARMV8 is a "smallsh" ISA, but still over 1000 instructions, most are variations of one another
- LEGV8 has about 50 instructions

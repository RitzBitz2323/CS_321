#### Moore's Law - Gordon Moore Intel CEO 1950s
	Transistor Density increases exponentially
#### Items which affect program performance
- Choice of algorithm
- Language
- Compiler
- Architecture
	- ISA : Instruction Set Architecture (analogous to an API)
		- essentially the assembly for the architecture
		- ADD X0, X9, X12 means X0  = X9 + X12
	- Microarchitecture ( and memory systems )
		- The physical implementation of the ISA
	- I/O Systems
		- Monitor, keyboard, hard drive, network, serial devices
